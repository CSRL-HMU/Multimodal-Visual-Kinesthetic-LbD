# Multimodal Visual Kinesthetic LbD: Towards multi-modal Learning by Demonstration: \\ Combining depthless visual data with kinesthetic teaching

This implements the Multimodal LbD, combining visual observation with kinesthetic corrections.

he research project "CARPOS - Coachable Robot for Fruit Picking Operations" is implemented in the framework of H.F.R.I call "Basic Research Financing (Horizontal support of all Sciences)" under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan "Greece 2.0" funded by the European Union â€“ NextGenerationEU(H.F.R.I. Project Number: 16523).

## 1. Usage

For the initial visual training:

```
python3 XXXX.py

```

After this tarining, a DMP_model.m and a training_data.m file will be created

For running the kinesthetic correctins controller:

```
python3 YYYYY.py

```
